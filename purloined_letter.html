            <span class="explanation">At Paris, just after dark one gusty evening in the autumn of 18—, I was enjoying the twofold luxury of meditation and a meerschaum, in company with my friend, C. Auguste Dupin, in his little back library, or book-closet, au troisiéme, No. 33 Rue Dunot, Faubourg St. Germain. For one hour at least we had maintained a profound silence; while each, to any casual observer, might have seemed intently and exclusively occupied with the curling eddies of smoke that oppressed the atmosphere of the chamber. For myself, however, I was mentally discussing certain topics which had formed matter for conversation between us at an earlier period of the evening; I mean the affair of the Rue Morgue, and the mystery attending the murder of Marie Roget. I looked upon it, therefore, as something of a coincidence, when the door of our apartment was thrown open and admitted our old acquaintance, Monsieur G—, the Prefect of the Parisian police. We gave him a hearty welcome; for there was nearly half as much of the entertaining as of the contemptible about the man, and we had not seen him for several years. We had been sitting in the dark, and Dupin now arose for the purpose of lighting a lamp, but sat down again, without doing so, upon G.’s saying that he had called to consult us, or rather to ask the opinion of my friend, about some official business which had occasioned a great deal of trouble. </span> <span class="dupin dupin1"><span class="dupinsaid">"If it is any point requiring reflection,"</span> observed Dupin, as he forbore to enkindle the wick, <span class="dupinsaid">"we shall examine it to better purpose in the dark."</span></span> <span class="g g1"><span class="gsaid">"That is another of your odd notions,"</span> said the Prefect, who had the fashion of calling everything ‘odd’ that was beyond his comprehension, and thus lived amid an absolute legion of ‘oddities.’</span>
            <span class="dupin dupin2"><span class="dupinsaid">"Very true,"</span> said Dupin, as he supplied his visitor with a pipe, and rolled toward him a comfortable chair. </span><span class="i i1"><span class="isaid">"And what is the difficulty now?"</span> I asked.<span class="isaid">"Nothing more in the assassination way, I hope?"</span></span><span class="g g2 gsaid"> "Oh, no; nothing of that nature. The fact is, the business is very simple indeed, and I make no doubt that we can manage it sufficiently well ourselves; but then I thought Dupin would like to hear the details of it, because it is so excessively odd."</span> <span class="dupin dupin3"><span class="dupinsaid">"Simple and odd,"</span>said Dupin.</span>

            <span class="g g3 gsaid">"Why, yes; and not exactly that either. The fact is, we have all been a good deal puzzled because the affair is so simple, and yet baffles us altogether."</span> <span class="dupin dupin4 "><span class="dupinsaid">Perhaps it is the very simplicity of the thing which puts you at fault,"</span> said my friend.</span> <span class="g g4"><span class="gsaid">What nonsense you do talk!"</span>replied the Prefect, laughing heartily.</span>

            <span class="dupin dupin5"><span class="dupinsaid">Perhaps the mystery is a little too plain,"</span> said Dupin.</span> <span class="g g5 gsaid">"Oh good heavens! who ever heard of such an idea?"</span><span class="dupin dupin6 dupinsaid">"A little too self-evident."</span><span class="g g6"><span class="gsaid">"Ha! ha! ha! — ha! ha! ha! — ho! ho! ho!"</span> roared our visitor, profoundly amused,<span class="gsaid">"oh Dupin, you will be the death of me yet!"</span></span>

            <span class="i i2"><span class="isaid">And what, after all, is the matter on hand?"</span> I asked.</span> <span class="g g7"><span class="gsaid">"Why, I will tell you,"</span> replied the Prefect, and he gave a long, steady, and contemplative puff, and settled himself in his chair. <span class="gsaid">"I will tell you in a few words; but, before I begin, let me caution you that this is an affair demanding the greatest secrecy, and that I should most probably lose the position I now hold, were it known that I confided it to any one."</span></span>
            <span class="i i3"><span class="isaid">"Proceed,"</span> said I.</span> <span class="dupin dupin7"><span class="dupinsaid">"Or not,"</span> said Dupin.</span> <span class="g g8 gsaid">"Well, then; I have received personal information, from a very high quarter, that a certain document of the last importance has been purloined from the royal apartments. The individual who purloined it is known; this beyond a doubt; he was seen to take it. It is know, also, that i still remains in his possession."</span> <span class="dupin dupin8"><span class="dupinsaid">"How is this know?"</span> asked Dupin.</span> <span class="g g9"><span class="gsaid">"It is clearly inferred,"</span> replied the Prefect, <span class="gsaid">"from the nature of the document, and from the non-appearance of certain results which would at once arise from its passing out of the robber’s possession—that is to say, from his employing it as he must design in the end to employ it."</span></span> <span class="i i4"><span class="isaid">"Be a little more explicit,"</span> I said.</span> <span class="g g10"><span class="gsaid">"Well, I may venture so far as to say that the paper gives its holder a certain power in a certain quarter where such power is immensely valuable."</span> The Prefect was fond of the can’t of diplomacy.</span> <span class="dupin dupin10"><span class="dupinsaid">"Still I do not quite understand,"</span> said Dupin.</span> <span class="g g11 gsaid">"No? Well; the disclosure of the document to a third person, who shall be nameless, would bring in question the honor of a personage of most exalted station; and this fact gives the holder of the document an ascendancy over the illustrious personage whose honor and peace are so jeopardized."</span> <span class="i i5"><span class="isaid">"But this ascendancy,"</span> I interposed,<span class="isaid">"would depend upon the robber’s knowledge of the loser’s know ledge of the robber. Who would dare —"</span></span> <span class="g g12"><span class="gsaid">"The thief,"</span> said G., <span class="gsaid">"is the Minister D—, who dares all things, those unbecoming as well as those becoming a man. The method of the theft was not less ingenious than bold. The document in question—a letter, to be frank—had been received by the personage robbed while alone in the royal boudoir. During its perusal she was suddenly interrupted by the entrance of the other exalted personage from whom especially it was her wish to conceal it. After a hurried and vain endeavor to thrust it in a drawer, she was forced to place it, open it was, upon a table. The address, however, was uppermost, and, the contents thus unexposed, the letter escaped notice. At this juncture enters the Minister D—. His lynx eye immediately perceives the paper, recognizes the handwriting of the address, observes the confusion of the personage addressed, and fathoms her secret. After some business transactions, hurried through in his ordinary manner, he produces a letter somewhat similar to the one in question, opens it, pretends to read it, and then places it in close juxtaposition to the other. Again he converses, for some fifteen minutes, upon the public affairs. At length, in taking leave, he takes also from the table the letter to which he had no claim. Its rightful owner saw, but, of course, dared not call attention to the act, in the presence of the third personage who stood at her elbow. The minister decamped; leaving his own letter—one of no importance—upon the table."</span></span>
            <span class="dupin dupin11"><span class="dupinsaid">"Here, then,"</span> said Dupin to me, <span class="dupinsaid">"you have precisely what you demand to make the ascendancy complete—the robber’s knowledge of the loser’s knowledge of the robber."</span></span> <span class="g g13"><span class="gsaid">"Yes,"</span> replied the Prefect;<span class="gsaid">"and the power thus attained has, for some months past, been wielded, for political purposes, to a very dangerous extent. The personage robbed is more thoroughly convinced, every day, of the necessity of reclaiming her letter. But this, of course, cannot be done openly. In fine, driven to despair, she has committed the matter to me."</span></span><span class="dupin dupin12"><span class="dupinsaid">"Than whom,"</span> said Dupin, amid a perfect whirlwind of smoke,<span class="dupinsaid">"no more sagacious agent could, I suppose, be desired, or even imagined."</span></span> <span class="g g14"><span class="gsaid">"You flatter me,"</span> replied the Prefect; <span class="gsaid">"but it is possible that some such opinion may have been entertained."</span></span>

            <div class="second">
                <div class="c"><span class="left dupinsaid">"Full of these idea, I prepared myself with a pair of green spectacles, and called one fine morning, quite by accident, at the Misterial hotel. I found D— at home, yawning, lounging, and dawdling, as usual, and pretending to be in the last extremity of ennui. He is, perhaps, the most really energetic human being now alive—but that is only when nobody sees him. To be even with him, I complained of my weak eyes, and lamented the necessity of the spectacles, under cover of which I cautiously and thoroughly surveyed the whole apartment, while seemingly intent only upon the conversation of my host. I paid especial attention to a large writing-table near which he say, and upon which lay confusedly, some miscellaneous letters and other papers, with one or two musical instruments and a few books. Here, however, after a long and very deliberate scrutiny, I saw nothing to excite particular suspicion. ‘At length my eyes, in going the circuit of the room, fell upon a trumpery filigree card-rack of pasteboard, that hung dangling by a dirty blue ribbon, from a little brass knob just beneath the middle of the mantel-piece. In this rack, which had three or four compartments, were five or six visiting cards and a solitary letter. This last was much soiled and crumpled. It was torn nearly in tow, across the middle—as if a design, in the first instance, to tear it entirely up a s worthless, had been altered, or stayed, in the second. It had a large black seal, bearing the D—cipher very conspicuously, and was addressed, in a diminutive female hand, to D—, the minister, himself. It was thrust carelessly, and even, as it seemed, contemptuously, into one of the uppermost divisions of the rack. ‘No sooner had I glanced at this letter than I concluded it to be that of which I was in search. To be sure, it was, to all appearance, radically different from the one of which the Prefect had read us so minute a description. Here the seal was large and black, with the D—cipher; there it was small and red, with the ducal arms of the S—family. Here, the address, to the minister, was diminutive and feminine; there the superscription, to a certain royal personage, was markedly bold and decided; the size alone formed a point of correspondence. But, then, the radicalness of these differences, which was excessive; the dirt; the soiled and torn condition of the paper, so inconsistent with the true methodical habits of D—, and so suggestive of a design to delude the beholder into an idea of the worthlessness of the document; —these things, together with the hyper obtrusive situation of this document, full in the view of every visitor, and thus exactly in accordance with the conclusions to which I had previously arrived; these things, I say, were strongly corroborative of suspicion, in one who came with the intention to suspect. ‘I protracted my visit as long as possible, and, while I maintained a most animated discussion with the minister, upon a topic which I knew well had never failed to interest and excite him, I kept my attention really riveted upon the letter. In this examination, I committed to memory its external appearance and arrangement in the rack; and also fell, at length, upon a discovery which set at rest whatever trivial doubt I might have entertained. In scrutinizing the edges of the paper, I observed them to be more chafed than seemed necessary. They presented the broken appearance which is manifested when a stiff paper, having been once folded and pressed with a folder, is refolded in a reversed direction, in the same creases or edges which had formed the original fold. This discovery was sufficient. It was clear to me that the letter had been turned, as a glove, inside out, re-directed and re-sealed. I bade the minister good-morning, and took my departure at once, leaving a gold snuff-box upon the table. ‘The next morning I called for the snuff-box, when we resumed, quite eagerly, the conversation of the preceding day. While thus engaged, however, a loud report, as if of a pistol, was heard immediately beneath the windows of the hotel, and was succeeded by a series of fearful screams, and the shoutings of a terrified mob. D— rushed to a casement, threw it open, and looked out. In the meantime I stepped to the card-rack, took the letter, put it in my pocket, and replaced it by a facsimile, (so far as regards externals) which I had carefully prepared at my lodgings—imitating the D—cipher, very readily, by means of a seal formed of bread. ‘The disturbance in the street had been occasioned by the frantic behavior of a man with a musket. He had fired it among a crowd of women and children. It proved, however, to have been without ball, and the fellow was suffered to go his way as a lunatic or a drunkard. When he had gone, D— came from the window, whither I had followed him immediately upon securing the object in view. Soon afterward I bade him farewell. The pretended lunatic was a man in my own pay."</span></div>

                <div class="c"><span class="right"><span class="isaid">"But what purpose had you,"</span> I asked,
                    <span class="isaid"> "in replacing the letter by a facsimile? Would it not have been better, at the first visit, to have seized it openly, and departed?"</span></span>
                </div>
                <div class="c"><span class="left"><span class="dupinsaid">"D—,"</span>replied Dupin, <span class="dupinsaid">‘is a desperate man, and a man of nerve. His hotel, too, is not without attendants devoted to his interests. Had I made the wild attempt you suggest, I might never have left the Ministerial presence alive. The good people of Paris might have heard of me no more. But I had an object apart from these considerations. You know my political prepossessions. In this matter, I act as a partisan of the lady concerned. For eighteen months the Minister has had her in his power. She has now him in hers—since, being unaware that the letter is not in his possession, he will proceed with his exactions as if it was. Thus will he inevitably commit himself, at once, to his political destruction. His downfall, too, will not be more precipitate than awkward. It is all very well to talk about the facilis descensus Averni; but in all kinds of climbing, as Catalani said of singing, it is far more easy to get up than to come down. In the present instance I have no sympathy—at least no pity—for him who descends. He is that monstrous horrendum, an unprincipled man of genius. I confess, however, that I should like very well to know the precise character of his thoughts, when, being defied by her whom the Prefect terms 'a certain personage,' he is reduced to opening the letter which I left for him in the card-rack."</span>

                <div class="c"><span class="left"><span class="isaid">"It is clear,"</span> said I,<span class="isaid"> "as you observe, that the letter is still in the possession of the minister; since it is this possession, and not any employment of the letter, which bestows the power. With the employment the power departs."</span></span>
                </div>
                <div class="c"><span class="right">
                    ‘True,’ said G.; ‘and upon this conviction I proceeded. My first care was to make thorough search of the minister’s hotel; and here my chief embarrassment lay in the necessity of searching without his knowledge. Beyond all things, I have been warned of the danger which would result from giving him reason to suspect our design.’</span></div>
                <div class="c"><span class="left"> ‘But,’ said I, ‘you are quite au fait in these investigations. The Parisian police have done this thing often before.’</span></div>
                <div class="c"><span class="right"> ‘Oh, yes; and for this reason I did not despair. The habits of absent from home all night. His servants are by no means numerous. They sleep at a distance from their master’s apartment, and being chiefly Neapolitans, are readily made drunk. I have keys, as you know, with which I can open any chamber or cabinet in Paris. For three months a night has not passed, during the greater part of which I have not been engaged, personally, in ransacking the D—Hotel. My honor is interested, and, to mention a great secret, the reward is enormous. So I did not abandon the search until I had become fully satisfied that the thief is a more astute man than myself. I fancy that I have investigated every nook and corner of the premises in which it is possible that the paper can be concealed.’</span></div>
                <div class="c"><span class="left"> ‘But is it not possible,’ I suggested, ‘that although the letter may be in possession of the minister, as it unquestionably is, he may have concealed it elsewhere than upon his own premises?’</span></div>
                <div class="c"><span class="left"> ‘This is barely possible,’ said Dupin. ‘The present peculiar condition of affairs at court, and especially of those intrigues in which D—is known to be involved, would render the instant availability of the document—its susceptibility of being produced at a moment’s notice—a point of nearly equal importance with its possession.’</span></div>
                <div class="c"><span class="left"> ‘Its susceptibility of being produced?’ said I.</span></div>
                <div class="c"><span class="left"> ‘That is to say, of being destroyed,’ said Dupin.</span></div>
                <div class="c"><span class="left"> ‘True,’ I observed; ‘the paper is clearly then upon the premises. As for its being upon the person of the minister, we may consider that as out of the question,’</span></div>
                <div class="c"><span class="right">‘Entirely,’ said the Prefect. ‘He has been twice waylaid, as if by foot-pads, and his person rigidly searched under my own inspection.’</span></div>
                <div class="c"><span class="left"> ‘You might have spared yourself this trouble,’ said Dupin. ‘D—, I presume, is not altogether a fool, and, if not, must have anticipated these waylaying, as a matter of course.’</span></div>
                <div class="c"><span class="right"> ‘Not altogether a fool,’ said G., ‘but then he is a poet, which I take to be only one remove from a fool.’</span></div>
                <div class="c"><span class="left"> ‘True,’ said Dupin, after a long and thoughtful whiff from his meerschaum, ‘although I have been guilty of certain doggerel myself.’</span></div>
                <div class="c"><span class="left"> ‘Suppose you detail,’ said I, ‘the particulars of your search.’</span></div>
                <div class="c"><span class="right"> ‘Why, the fact is, we took our time, and we searched everywhere. I have had long experience in these affairs. I took the week to each. We examined, first, the furniture of each apartment. We opened every possible drawer; and I presume you know that, to a properly trained police-agent, such a thing as 'secret' drawer is impossible. Any man is a dolt who permits a 'secret' drawer to escape him in a search of this kind. The thing is so plain. There is a certain amount of bulk—of space—to be accounted for in every cabinet. Then we have accurate rules. The fiftieth part of a line could not escape us. After the cabinets we took the chars. The cushions we probed with the fine long needles you have seen me employ. From the tables we removed the tops.’</span></div>
                <div class="c"><span class="left"> ‘Why so?’</span></div>
                <div class="c"><span class="right"> ‘Sometimes the top of a table, or other similarly arranged piece of furniture, is removed by the person wishing to conceal an article; then the leg is excavated, the article deposited within the cavity, and the top replaced. The bottoms and tops of bedposts are employed in the same way.’</span></div>
                <div class="c"><span class="left">‘But could not the cavity be detected by sounding?’ I asked.</span></div>
                <div class="c"><span class="right"> ‘By no means, if, when the article is deposited, a sufficient wadding of cotton be placed around it. Besides, in our case, we were obliged to proceed without noise.’</span></div>
                <div class="c"><span class="left"> ‘But you could not have removed—you could not have taken to pieces all articles of furniture in which it would have been possible to make a deposit in the manner you mention. A letter may be compressed into a thin spiral roll, not differing much in shape or bulk from a large knitting-needle, and in this form it might be inserted into the rung of a chair, for example. You did not take to pieces all the chairs?’</span></div>
                <div class="c"><span class="right"> ‘Certainly not; but we did better—we examined the rungs of every chair in the hotel, and indeed, the jointing of every description of furniture, by the aid of a most powerful microscope. Had there been any traces of recent disturbance we should not have failed to detect it instantly. A single grain of gimlet-dust, for example, would have been as obvious as an apple. Any disorder in the gluing—any unusual gaping in the joints—would have sufficed to insure detection.’</span></div>
                <div class="c"><span class="left"> ‘I presume you looked to the mirrors, between the boards and the plates, and you probed the beds and the bedclothes, as well as the curtains and carpets.’</span></div>
                <div class="c"><span class="right"> ‘That of course; and when we had absolutely completed every particle of the furniture in this way, then we examined the house itself. We divided its entire surface into compartments, which we numbered, so that none might be missed; then we scrutinized each individual square inch throughout the premises, including the two houses immediately adjoining, with the microscope, as before.’</span></div>
                <div class="c"><span class="right">‘The two houses adjoining!’ I exclaimed ‘you must have had a great deal of trouble.’</span></div>
                <div class="c"><span class="right">‘We had; but the reward offered is prodigious.’</span></div>
                <div class="c"><span class="left">‘You include the grounds about the houses?’</span></div>
                <div class="c"><span class="right"> ‘All the grounds are paved with brick. They gave us comparatively little trouble. We examined the moss between the bricks, and found it undisturbed.’ ‘You looked among D—’s papers, of course, and into the books of the library?’ ‘Certainly; we opened every package and parcel; we not only opened every book, but we turned over every leaf in each volume, not contenting ourselves with a mere shake, according to the fashion of some of our police officers. We also measured the thickness of every book-cover, with the most accurate admeasurement, and applied to each the most jealous scrutiny of the microscope. Had any of the binding been recently meddled with, it would have been utterly impossible that the fact should have escaped observation. Some five or six volumes, just from the hands of the binder, we carefully probed, longitudinally, with the needles.’ ‘You explored the floors beneath the carpets?’ ‘Beyond doubt. We removed every carpet, and examined the boards with the microscope.’ ‘And the paper on the walls?’ ‘Yes.’ ‘You looked into the cellars?’ ‘We did.’ ‘Then,’ I said, ‘you have been making a miscalculation, and the letter in not upon the premises, as you suppose.’ ‘I fear you are right there,’ said the Prefect. ‘And now, Dupin, what would you advise me to do?’ ‘To make a thorough research of the premises.’ ‘That is absolutely needless,’ replied G—. ‘I am not more sure that I breathe than I am that the letter is not at the hotel.’ ‘I have no better advice to give you,’ said Dupin. ‘You have, of course, an accurate description of the letter?’ ‘Oh, yes!’—And here the Prefect, producing a memorandum book, proceeded to read aloud a minute account of the internal, and especially of the external, appearance of the missing document. Soon after finishing the perusal of this description, he took his departure, more entirely depressed in spirits than I had ever known the good gentleman before.

‘Why—it did not seem altogether right to leave the interior blank—that would have been insulting. D—, at Vienna once, did me an evil turn, which I told him, quite good-humoredly, that I should remember. So, as I knew he would feel some curiosity in regard to the identity of the person who had outwitted him, I thought it a pity not to give him a clew.
